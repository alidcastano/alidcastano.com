title: One Small Thing
---

One thoughtful gesture is all it takes to the start of a friendship. 

One ardent feeling is all it takes to start a poem.

One surprising realization is all it takes to start of an essay. 

One pesky problem is all it takes to start of a company.

One disinterested obsession is all it takes to start a journey. 

One small thing is all it takes to start.
