The good ol’ fitness days <br>
I’d strike a pose in all types of ways <br> 
with no regard for what others thought of me <br>
flex dem abs, that’s all they gotta see <br> 
that how I learned to think at least <br> 
it’s the proud culture of the south-east <br> 
took that persona with me to the U of Penn <br>
let’s just say, i’d have been better at the U of M <br>
but how glad I am to have seen a new culture <br> 
a new environment to form my restructure <br> 
so this one goes out to the friends that set me free <br>
they made fun of my gram and helped me see <br>
if I can’t laugh at myself I should move to something different <br> 
cause it’s what I can’t help but take seriously that makes me different <br>
