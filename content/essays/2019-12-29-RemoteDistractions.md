I’m lucky enough to work remotely. So I can work from anywhere in the world. Yet, for the past two months, I've chosen to be in Minneapolis, where my parents live. I came back for the holidays and had thought about leaving right after to escape the cold winter and start the new year in Mexico. But instead, I stayed here.

I'll admit, I spent a day searching reddit for hipster neighborhoods in Mexico City and looking at flights and airbnbs. But it was doing that that made me think: what the hell am I doing? I don't care to be traveling right now, I have a lot in the backlog of my mind and would much rather spend my days at home writing and coding.

My focus isn't travel, but work. I'd rather live like a king in Latin America than spend $3k in rent/month in San Francisco; but, if I'm true to myself, I'd rather lock myself up at home for a few months, if that means being able to work without distractions.

When I travel, I spend the majority of my day doing what I'd be doing at home: sitting at a computer, drinking coffee, working. Except, since I just arrived in a new city, I feel like I need to be out exploring! Whereas at home, it's understood to be boring. So all the adventure can reside inside in my mind. And, at least for the next few months, that's how I want it to be.

Ideally, I'd have the mental fortitude to work like a hermit longer. But there's a lot at play that prevents me from doing so, and I'd like to try and pick those reasons apart.

#### Appearances

For starters, I used to be embarrassed about saying I'm living with my Mom. But now that I can work from anywhere, it doesn't bother me as much. It seems that what matters in appearances is the display of freedom, and it's just easier to show you have it as you travel through Asia and Latin America. Who's going to believe I choose to stay at home and work? But at this point in my life, that's what I'd prefer to be doing.

Though even if I could subvert caring about appearances, I don't think living with one's parents too long is healthy. At least not in my situation. My mom lives 45 mins away from downtown, and the closest coffee shop is 6 minutes away driving. So I don't leave the house or socialize much while here. For a few months to focus on work, that's exactly what I'm looking for, but anything longer can get depressing.

So to some extent, then, it's healthy to make appearances. To go out and socialize and live in the real world. It's easier for me to do that while traveling, since I can cheaply live in the center of where things are happening. The grocery store, gym, and coffee shop are a few blocks away, and the mall and disco aren't much further. I have all the amenities I need to balance work and play.

But sometimes all I want to do is work. So in those times, remote work makes me feel like the only kid in recess who stayed inside to do their homework. I'm doing what I want to be doing, but it feels wrong. I believe most unhappiness is caused by these sort of unresolved value conflicts. So it's important to know what one wants, and to learn to be shameless about wanting it.

#### Richness

Indeed, work already feels like play for me. So what I want, is to be around people with similar interests, who also get excited about work. Then we can all play together!

It's easier to meet people while traveling. But most of these friendships feel transient; and even if they weren't, the culture feels off. The people I meet in Medellin or Mexico city are different than those who I'd meet in San Francisco or New york. So as someone who was raised with American values and likes tech, I feel I'm not living where I should be; and that, while I'm meeting lovely people, I'm making the wrong friends.

So the most obvious question is: why not move there instead? Because I want to work on someone else's dime as possible. So, if I increase my expenses, I have to do more paid work; and that means less time to invest in my projects, which are less financially viable now but I believe will give me financial independence later.

Above friendships, I want to focus on work. Maybe I'm not thinking long-term enough, sure. But at least I'm being true to what I feel compelled to work on.

If I didn't have my own idea I wanted to create, I'd get a job, get paid well, and meet people in a big city. But I do have my idea, and even if I already spent a year working on two iterations, it's still there, and I feel destined to work upon it. So I'd much rather work 4-6 hours a day contracting and use all my other time to focus on work.
(doing contracting work bnecause i have to earn right to work for myself. but i'm  so privegeled to have flexiblity over my schedule while I get there.)

Plus, I think the most important part to meeting people I want to meet is making something of myself first. I want to be the person I'd like to meet.

For me the second luckiest people aren't those traveling the world, but those who found a community of people they enjoy working with/around. The luckiest people, of course, are those who found work they truly love. They love it so much that they don't care whether they're working alone or with anybody else.

What makes an experience rich isn't where you're at or who you're with, but whether you feel it's meant for you at this point in time. We have so many inner conflicts that it's hard to give advice like "move to a big city" or "travel," no one knows what you really want from life except you. And no one will believe in your work and own abilities like you do.

((mix up of caring about my mom but not wanting to take on all her problems.. carlos, marcus, jamie.. seems like when im home more of it falls on me, and when im not somehow she gets by.
((not complete control of my schedule here, prefer to live downtown in minnapolis if ima be here... but then not saving money, nor putting it to help my families financial situation.))

### Balance

So why don't I stay home longer? Get too out of touch with life. I'm young and want to have a good dating life. Not full control over my schedule at home -- no car, for example; but also find it harder to go to gym compared to just jogging in warm weather... when im home all day, more ungrommed, take care of myself less, not the same person as when i have my own apartment somewhere. ((Just now I was at grocery store, saw a pretty girl. Made me feel ungrommed and anti-social. I don't like that. I like to be always ready.))

It's important to play the long game. At least for me, since I like to take my time and make things my own way. When things in my work aren't going well it's important to have other things in life to give life meaning.

I believe the best mix is: going out and living life, and then locking yourself up to process it.
((If I had to choose between traveling or living in my head, I'd pick living in my head 3 months out of the year. lol.))

 
When your main priority is work the last thing you want is novelty. You want all the surprises to come from your mind, not from your environment.


Above all, I live in my head. So every now and then I have to make sure I'm in a place that lets me return there.
