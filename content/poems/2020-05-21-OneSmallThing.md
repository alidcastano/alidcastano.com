One thoughtful gesture is all it takes to start a friendship. 

One surprising thought is all it takes to start a blog. 

One pesky problem is all it takes to start a company.

One avid follower is all it takes to start a movement.

One mismet expectation is all it takes to start anew.

One small thing is all it takes to start.
