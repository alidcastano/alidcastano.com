title: waitress, please
---

i met her at a restaurant across the street <br>
she was the waitress who took me to my seat <br>
“hola cómo estás”  was what I said <br>
“sabes que quieres?” she replied instead <br>
“tienen wifi?” I countered <br> 
“12345678”, she counted <br>
i plugged it into my computer, pretended to work <br> 
couldn’t keep my eyes of her, I had to lurk <br> 
i asked about her favorite plate just to get her started <br> 
she chose one I dislike, that’s OK, I was lighthearted <br> 
she had great energy, her style was rare <br>
i waited for her to lap around again near my chair <br>
“Can I have another drink?” I said, just to talk again <br>
“Hey, what’s your number?” we’ll see what happens then <br>
