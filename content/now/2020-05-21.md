I've been mostly at home, given everything that's going on with Coronavirus. Very thankful to have a steady, remote consulting gig during these times. Also spending a lot more family time, given that my four brothers are also home.

Other than that, I've been spending my days reading, writing, and coding. Particularly, I've been writing about coding, and I feel like it's helping to ground my understanding of good and bad code.

The last few days I also started learning to play guitar. It's a skill I've wanted to learn for a while and my mom, knowing this, surprised me with a guitar, and my little brother (who's also been learning) nudged me to finally get started. So I'm committing to doing 10-20 minutes a day. It's great to have apps like Yousician that streamline this learning process. 

I'm still as passionate as ever about note-taking and digital tools for thought. But nothing new to mention, yet.
